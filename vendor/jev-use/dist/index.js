/**
 * jev-use public API.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Jev, check, pick, rate } from "jev-use";
 *
 * const jev = new Jev();
 * const { answers } = await jev.judge(state, { passed: check("Did the run fully succeed?") });
 * ```
 *
 * Both halves of the handoff are here: `route` decides before any call that a
 * step is the LLM's (`writing` / `open_ended`), and every verdict carries
 * `escalate` + `reason` + `hint` for the boundaries only Jev can see.
 *
 * The engine (`judge`/`gate`/the screening functions), the backend resolver
 * and the MCP server live one import deeper — `jev-use/dist/judge.js` and
 * friends — because they are the harness-facing internals, not the surface a
 * caller writes against.
