/**
 * The engine: screen the questions, call the backend, hand back what Jev is
 * unsure about — producing verdicts that always come back in the caller's
 * question order, with escalations in-band. These functions must never throw
 * for reachable-world reasons: an unreachable backend degrades to
 * escalate-everything.
 *
 * Callers writing code use the `Jev` client, which wraps this; the wire
 * surfaces (MCP tools, pi tools, `jev-use judge`) call it directly because
 * the ordered `JudgeResult` is exactly their payload.
